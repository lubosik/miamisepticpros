    "Drain fields (also called leach fields) are underground systems of perforated pipes that distribute treated wastewater from septic tanks into surrounding soil for final treatment and disposal",

    "Signs of drain field failure include slow drains, wet spots or standing water in yard, foul odors, unusually green grass over drain field, and sewage backups in home",
    "Repair methods include aeration treatment to restore soil permeability, pipe cleaning/jetting, and partial field restoration for localized problems",
    "Miami's high water table and heavy clay soils make drain field problems more common and repair more challenging than in other areas",
    "When drain fields fail completely, replacement is usually required rather than repair, making early intervention and repair critical for cost savings",
    "Drain field work requires permits from Miami-Dade County and Florida DOH, with soil testing and system design often required before approval",
    "Miami-Dade County prohibits conventional drain fields for new systems (since 2023), requiring advanced treatment systems that are more expensive but more reliable"
