    "Septic system expansion in Miami-Dade typically costs $6,000-$15,000 depending on scope, whether drainfield expansion or additional capacity needed, site conditions, and permit requirements",
    "Expansion needed when existing system capacity insufficient for increased household size, adding bedrooms or bathrooms, increased water usage exceeding system capacity, or drainfield showing signs of overload",
    "Expansion process includes system evaluation to determine current capacity and needs, site assessment to identify expansion options, permit application for modifications, drainfield expansion or additional lines, connection to existing system, and final inspection",
    "Miami-Dade County requires permits for all septic system modifications including expansions, with new components meeting current standards including elevation requirements (36 inches above high water table) and setback distances",
    "Expansion typically takes 2-4 weeks from permit approval through completion, longer if new drainfield location needed or site modifications required to meet current standards",
    "Expansion vs replacement decision depends on system age, condition of existing components, available space for expansion, cost comparison, and whether expansion can meet increased capacity needs",
    "Drainfield expansion involves adding additional distribution lines to existing drainfield or installing new drainfield area, requiring proper soil conditions, adequate space, and meeting current installation standards",
    "Professional expansion ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County regulations, proper capacity calculations, appropriate expansion methods, meeting elevation and setback requirements, and long-term system reliability"
