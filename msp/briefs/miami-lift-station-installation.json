    "Lift stations pump sewage from lower elevations to higher elevations or treatment facilities when gravity flow is not feasible, essential in Miami-Dade's flat topography requiring mechanical pumping",
    "Lift station installation in Miami-Dade typically costs $15,000-$50,000 depending on pump capacity, station type, site conditions, electrical requirements, and installation complexity",
    "Standard submersible lift stations are used for locations requiring up to approximately 60 horsepower per pump, generally less than 24 feet wet well depth, and typically 2 pumps",
    "Wet well/dry well configurations are used when lift stations require individual pumps greater than 60 horsepower, providing separation between pumping area and sump area for larger equipment",
    "Miami-Dade classifies all wet wells as Permit Required Confined Spaces requiring OSHA compliance, proper ventilation systems, and Class I Division 2 electrical classifications",
    "All new or replacement lift station installations require mandatory prior written approval from Miami-Dade County director before construction, including design review and permit approval",
    "Miami-Dade requires ventilation for submersible lift stations, wet-wells, vented dry-wells, and valve vaults, with preferred control housing in separate electrical/control buildings",
    "Professional installation ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County design standards, proper pump sizing, electrical safety, confined space protocols, environmental protection, and long-term reliability"
