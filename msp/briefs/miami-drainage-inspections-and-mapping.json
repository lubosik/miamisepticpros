    "Drainage inspections and mapping in Miami typically cost $800-$2,500 for professional engineering services depending on property size, complexity of existing drainage systems, extent of required analysis, mapping detail level, and regulatory review requirements, with basic residential inspections costing $800-$1,500 and comprehensive commercial mapping costing $2,000-$4,000",
    "Drainage inspections involve comprehensive assessments of property water management systems including evaluation of grading, existing drainage structures, stormwater runoff patterns, and potential flooding risks conducted by licensed Professional Engineers analyzing how water moves across and away from property",
    "Drainage mapping utilizes geographic information system technology to document and visualize drainage infrastructure across Miami-Dade County through iWASD GIS Service Maps allowing property owners and developers to search construction project information, determine if properties are connected to water and sewer systems, and access information about ongoing construction projects and utility coordination",
    "Drainage inspections and mapping required for new residential or commercial construction, regrading or changes to lot elevations, adding impervious surfaces such as driveways or patios, properties working in flood zones or near coastal areas, projects that increase stormwater runoff, and civil works or transportation projects affecting stormwater discharge including new roadways",
    "Drainage inspection process includes topographic analysis beginning with survey of elevations and site features, hydrologic modeling involving stormwater runoff estimation based on historical rainfall data, collection system design proposing infrastructure solutions including swales, channels, pipes, and catch basins, regulatory review validating proposed design with county and state code requirements, professional sealing requiring signature and license of registered Florida drainage engineer, and municipal approval involving submission for review and feedback before final implementation",
    "Water Control Map establishes guidelines and requirements for designing water control facilities showing locations of proposed canals, levees, dams, control structures, pump stations, drainage divides, and other drainage features of Miami-Dade County Water Control System, with minimum Flood Protection Level of Service standards based on analysis of flood conditions from 25-year/3-day and 10-year/24-hour storm events plus sea level rise forecasts of 2 feet and above expected by year 2060",
    "Drainage plans must be prepared by qualified civil engineer with drainage design expertise specific to Miami-Dade County environments, include all required technical engineering documentation signed and sealed by Florida-licensed Professional Engineer (PE), and submitted to Miami-Dade County Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Division of Environmental Resources Management (DERM) along with building permit package to Miami-Dade RER, local municipal building department, and other agencies such as South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) or DERM if required",
    "Professional drainage inspections and mapping provide regulatory compliance ensuring adherence to complex county and state regulations, cost avoidance identifying potential drainage issues early preventing costly revisions during construction, flood risk mitigation determining appropriate elevation and drainage design protecting properties in flood-prone areas, infrastructure coordination with multiple agencies and municipalities streamlining permitting process, accurate planning through hydrologic modeling and topographic analysis, and quality assurance ensuring plan meets all design specifications and engineering standards"
