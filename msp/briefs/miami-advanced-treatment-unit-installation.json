    "Advanced Treatment Units (ATUs) use oxygen to break down septic waste more efficiently than conventional anaerobic septic tanks, injecting air through mechanical blowers or compressors to create oxygen-rich environment supporting specialized bacteria",
    "ATU installation in Miami-Dade typically costs $12,000-$25,000 depending on system type, capacity, site conditions, and installation complexity, with ATUs generally costing more than conventional systems due to mechanical components",
    "ATUs produce substantially better wastewater treatment than conventional systems, with properly operating units producing effluent with less than 30 mg/L BOD, less than 25 mg/L TSS, and less than 10,000 CFU/100ml fecal coliform bacteria",
    "ATU systems can work effectively with smaller drainfields than conventional systems, making them suitable for properties with limited space, high groundwater tables, or challenging soil conditions requiring superior effluent quality",
    "Miami-Dade County requires Type 2, Type 3, or Type 4 systems for new installations, with ATUs typically falling into Type 3 (advanced secondary treatment) or Type 4 (nutrient reduction) categories meeting stricter environmental standards",
    "ATU systems require annual or semi-annual professional maintenance due to mechanical components including pumps, aerators, blowers, and compressors that must be inspected and serviced to maintain treatment effectiveness and compliance",
    "Three primary ATU types include suspended-growth systems with bacteria in wastewater, fixed-film systems using porous media for bacterial biofilm, and sequencing batch reactors combining treatment in single chamber",
    "Professional ATU installation ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County Type 3 or Type 4 requirements, proper mechanical component installation, electrical system setup, operating permit acquisition, environmental protection, and long-term system reliability"
