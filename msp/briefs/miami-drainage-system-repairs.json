    "Blockage and accumulation of sediment and debris in drainage systems are leading causes of flooding in Miami-Dade County, with grass clippings, leaves, debris, and excessive lawn care products blown into stormwater inlets causing system failures",
    "Common signs drainage systems need repair include standing water after rainfall, visible flooding during average rain events, clogged storm drains with visible debris, sinkholes or subsidence around drainage structures, foul odors from drains, and foundation water intrusion",
    "Drainage repair process includes field inspection of existing systems, pipe desilting to inspect joints and identify structural deficiencies, video inspection where access allows, coordination with drainage and maintenance offices, and comprehensive summary report of findings",
    "Emergency drainage repairs for flooding situations in Miami-Dade require contacting 311 for immediate flooding reports or municipal Public Works Departments during business hours, with Miami-Dade County Stormwater Utility addressing polluted stormwater and flooding susceptibility",
    "Preventive maintenance to avoid drainage repairs includes following manufacturer instructions for pesticides and fertilizers, proper storage and disposal of chemicals at Miami-Dade County Home Chemical Collection Center, disposing litter and yard waste properly, and avoiding paving or filling grass swales designed to hold water",
    "Repair vs replacement decision depends on corrosion assessment of existing pipes, pressure rating requirements with pipes over 10 psi requiring replacement, utility conflict resolution potentially requiring relocation, and embankment considerations requiring geotechnical coordination",
    "Professional drainage repair ensures proper diagnostic assessment using video inspection, compliance with FDOT drainage design standards, coordination with multiple agencies, adequate maintenance access for future repairs, and long-term system reliability preventing cascading failures"
