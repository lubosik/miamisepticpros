    "Catch basin installation in Miami typically costs $500-$5,000 per basin depending on size, material (plastic vs concrete), installation depth, and connection to drainage systems, with plastic basins costing $200-$500 and concrete basins costing $2,000-$5,000",
    "Catch basins are rectangular or circular basins that collect surface water and direct it into drainage pipes or channels, featuring grated inlets allowing water flow while preventing larger debris from entering the system and sump areas collecting sediment and pollutants",
    "Catch basins work through gravity-based mechanisms where water flows into grated surface openings, is temporarily stored in sump areas where solid particles settle, and cleaner water flows through drainage pipes to larger water management systems preventing flooding",
    "Catch basins needed in low-lying areas collecting stormwater runoff, high-debris environments like parking lots and landscaping zones, areas prone to urban flooding, and zones with significant surface runoff during Miami's heavy tropical rainfall",
    "Installation process includes site assessment identifying low points where water collects, excavation to appropriate depth for basin placement, positioning basin with proper alignment for water flow, connecting pipes to drainage systems, and securing grated inlet at surface level",
    "Maintenance requirements include regular debris removal from sump areas, cleaning and inspecting grates preventing blockages, professional vacuum truck cleaning removing accumulated pollutants and sediment, and more frequent maintenance during hurricane season when debris accumulates heavily",
    "Benefits of catch basins for Miami's heavy rainfall include flood prevention by capturing and directing stormwater runoff, erosion control reducing uncontrolled water flow, water quality protection trapping pollutants before reaching waterways, infrastructure protection preventing water damage, and environmental compliance with local regulations",
    "Professional catch basin installation ensures proper placement at strategic low points, compliance with Miami-Dade County stormwater management ordinances and Environmental Resource Permit requirements, integration with municipal drainage systems, proper material selection resisting saltwater corrosion, and long-term functionality preventing flooding and water quality degradation"
