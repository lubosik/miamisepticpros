    "Enzyme treatments contain biological enzymes that break down organic waste materials in septic tanks, helping digest solids and reduce sludge accumulation",
    "Enzyme treatments typically cost $20-$60 per treatment in Miami-Dade, applied monthly or quarterly depending on product and system needs",
    "Enzyme treatments work best as preventive maintenance, helping break down waste before it accumulates, but may not solve existing severe problems",
    "Enzyme treatments differ from bacterial additives by focusing on breaking down specific organic compounds rather than adding living bacteria to systems",
    "Enzyme treatments are most effective when used regularly as maintenance, helping reduce need for frequent pumping and maintaining optimal tank function",
    "Miami's warm climate can support enzyme activity, but effectiveness depends on proper tank conditions and regular maintenance practices",
    "Enzyme treatments may help reduce odors, break down grease, and improve system function when used appropriately, but professional evaluation is needed for serious problems",
    "Overuse of enzyme treatments or using inappropriate products can disrupt natural tank balance, so professional guidance is recommended"
