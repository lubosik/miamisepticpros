    "Wastewater treatment system installation in Miami typically costs $10,000-$50,000 for professional installation depending on system type, property size, site conditions, treatment requirements, and installation complexity, with Type 2 systems costing $10,000-$20,000, Type 3 systems costing $20,000-$35,000, and Type 4 or PBTS systems costing $30,000-$60,000+",
    "Wastewater treatment system installation involves designing, permitting, and constructing systems to properly manage and treat residential or commercial wastewater when municipal sewer connections unavailable, requiring precision in design, quality materials, and proper installation to avoid backups, contamination, and property damage while ensuring compliance with Miami-Dade County regulations",
    "Wastewater treatment systems needed when property not connected to municipal sewer system, particularly common in Miami-Dade County for properties located beyond reach of public wastewater infrastructure, with properly installed and maintained system providing effective way to treat wastewater and protect groundwater quality when municipal sewer service not available",
    "Miami-Dade County classifies Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems (OSTDS) into four types effective January 1, 2023: Type 1 conventional systems no longer permitted for new installations, Type 2 systems meeting secondary treatment standards for single-family homes at least 1,000 feet from surface water, Type 3 systems meeting advanced secondary treatment standards for multifamily properties, and Type 4 systems adhering to Florida Keys Nutrient Reduction Treatment Standards for uses not meeting Type 2 or Type 3 criteria",
    "Wastewater treatment systems operate through two-stage biological process with septic tank phase using anaerobic bacteria breaking solids into liquid form and generating gas venting through building plumbing, and drainfield phase using aerobic bacteria providing secondary treatment while gravity draws water downward through soil layers providing filtration and evaporation occurring through soil covering drainfield",
    "Miami-Dade County requires mandatory prior written approval from Director of Environmental Resources Management for any new or replacement OSTDS installations, with systems maintaining minimum 100 feet from surface water bodies and 50 feet from property lines, drainfield bottom at least 36 inches above wet season high water table, and all existing OSTDS registered with DERM by January 1, 2024",
    "Professional wastewater treatment system installation ensures health and safety preventing contamination of groundwater and protecting public health, protects property value avoiding expensive repairs and regulatory penalties, handles full permitting process reducing stress and ensuring compliance, conducts thorough site and soil evaluations using USDA NRCS methodology, and provides comprehensive reports with findings and recommendations informing optimal system design",
    "Performance-Based Treatment Systems (PBTS) provide advanced treatment solutions for challenging site conditions using custom design tailored to site-specific constraints while maintaining full regulatory compliance, offering enhanced performance for environmentally sensitive areas with comprehensive site evaluations digging test holes, analyzing soil samples, and determining wet season water tables through soil profile indicators"
