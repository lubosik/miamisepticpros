    "Septic tank baffles are internal devices at the inlet and outlet that control wastewater flow and prevent solids from entering the drain field",
    "Outlet baffles are the most critical component - if they fail, solids flow directly into the drain field causing expensive damage",
    "Older systems often have concrete baffles that deteriorate over time, while newer systems use durable PVC baffles",
    "Baffle replacement typically costs $200-$600 in Miami-Dade, depending on baffle type, access difficulty, and whether both inlet and outlet need replacement",
    "Signs of baffle problems include slow drains, backups, premature drain field failure, and solids appearing in effluent areas",
    "Proper baffle function prevents blockages, extends system life, and protects the drain field from costly damage",
    "Miami's high water table and heavy rainfall make properly functioning baffles especially important for system protection",
    "Baffle inspection and replacement should be done during routine septic maintenance, typically every 3-5 years"
