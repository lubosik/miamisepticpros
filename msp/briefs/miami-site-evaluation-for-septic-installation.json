    "Site evaluations must be performed by licensed engineer or other qualified professional as mandated by Florida regulations, ensuring standardized professional assessment before any septic system can be permitted",
    "Site evaluations fundamentally involve soil percolation testing to measure how quickly water flows through native soil, which directly determines absorption capacity and required absorption field size for system design",
    "Evaluations include comprehensive property assessment for nearby boundaries, water wells, topography, surface waters, and environmental factors between natural groundwater and wastewater contamination concerns",
    "Site evaluations are formally documented using DH4015 form which becomes part of official permit application, documenting all findings including soil characteristics, property features, and environmental conditions",
    "Effective January 1, 2023, Miami-Dade County prohibits conventional Type 1 septic systems for new installations, requiring site evaluations to support design of Type 2, 3, or 4 systems based on environmental sensitivity",
    "Site evaluations must document land use, sewer strength, sewage flow rate, loading capacity, and water supply connection status to determine appropriate system type meeting Miami-Dade County requirements",
    "Site evaluation directly determines system type selection, placement location considering setbacks from wells and property lines, system size based on percolation rate, and required treatment specifications for property",
    "Professional site evaluation ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County regulations, proper system design, environmental protection, groundwater quality protection, and long-term system reliability"
