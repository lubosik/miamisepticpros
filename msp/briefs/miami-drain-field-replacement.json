    "Drain field replacement in Miami-Dade typically costs $5,000-$15,000 depending on size, soil conditions, and whether installation requires elevated or specialized systems",
    "Complete drain field replacement is needed when drain fields fail completely, become saturated permanently, or cannot be restored through repair, typically when standing water persists or drainage fails",
    "Replacement process includes removing old drain field components, excavating new area or using existing location after restoration, installing new drain field meeting current standards, and final inspection",
    "Miami-Dade County requires permits for complete drain field replacement, and new drain fields must meet current system type requirements and elevation standards (36 inches above high water table)",
    "Replacement timeline typically takes 2-4 weeks from permit approval through final inspection, longer if new location is needed or specialized systems are required",
    "Signs indicating replacement needed include persistent standing water over drain field, sewage backing up into home, foul odors around system, slow drains throughout house, and soil saturation preventing drainage",
    "Professional replacement ensures compliance with current Miami-Dade regulations, proper installation for long-term function, environmental protection, and meeting elevation requirements for high water table",
    "Replacement costs are significantly higher than repairs but provide permanent solution, eliminate ongoing problems, ensure compliance with current standards, and restore system function for years to come"
