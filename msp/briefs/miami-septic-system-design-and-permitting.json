    "Miami-Dade County Ordinance 22-83 effective January 1, 2023 prohibits conventional Type 1 septic systems for new installations, requiring Type 2 (secondary treatment), Type 3 (advanced secondary), or Type 4 (nutrient reduction) systems instead",
    "Septic system design and permitting in Miami-Dade typically costs $1,500-$5,000 depending on system complexity, site conditions, engineering requirements, and DERM review timeline",
    "Design process includes site evaluation, soil testing, groundwater elevation assessment, system type selection, engineering design calculations, scaled site plan creation, and compliance verification with county and state regulations",
    "All new or replacement systems require prior written approval from Miami-Dade DERM Director before construction, including site plan, soil evaluation data, system design specifications, and proof of property ownership",
    "New systems must maintain minimum 100 feet horizontal setback from surface water bodies, 50 feet from property lines, and drainfield bottom must be 36 inches above wet season high water table",
    "Permit application requires scaled site plan showing structures, property lines, setbacks, system location, soil evaluation report, OSTDS design specifications conforming to Chapter 62-6, and professional engineer credentials",
    "DERM review and approval process typically takes 4-8 weeks after complete application submission, though timeline varies based on application completeness, site complexity, and DERM workload",
    "Design and permitting ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County regulations, proper system sizing and placement, environmental protection, groundwater quality protection, and long-term system reliability"
