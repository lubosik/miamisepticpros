      "fullDescription": "## What Is Septic Tank Pumping?\n\nSeptic tank pumping is the process of removing accumulated solids (sludge and scum) from your septic tank using a vacuum truck. Over time, these solids build up and reduce the tank's effective capacity. If not pumped regularly, solids can overflow into the drainfield, causing system failure and costly repairs.\n\n## Why You Need Regular Pumping\n\n- **Prevent backups:** Full tanks can cause sewage backups into your home\n- **Extend system life:** Regular pumping can add 10-20 years to your system\n- **Avoid drainfield damage:** Solids in the drainfield are expensive to fix\n- **Maintain health standards:** Proper maintenance prevents groundwater contamination\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Locate the tank access port (we can help if you don't know where it is)\n2. Pump out all liquids and solids using a vacuum truck\n3. Inspect tank condition and baffles\n4. Rinse and backflush if needed\n5. Document service for your records",

          "answer": "Most septic tanks should be pumped every 3–5 years, depending on household size, tank capacity, and water usage. Larger households or smaller tanks may need more frequent pumping."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does septic tank pumping cost?",
          "answer": "Average cost ranges from $300–$600, depending on tank size, location, and accessibility. Tanks larger than 1,500 gallons or in hard-to-reach locations may cost more."

          "question": "What happens if I don't pump my septic tank?",

          "question": "Can I pump my septic tank myself?",
