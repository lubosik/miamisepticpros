<h1>Surface Water Management Systems in Miami, FL</h1>

<p>Surface water management systems in Miami typically cost $5,000-$25,000 for property-level systems depending on size, components, integration with regional canal networks, and complexity of stormwater management requirements <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/permits/septic-tank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Miami-Dade Permits)</a>. Surface water management systems serve three primary functions in Miami-Dade County: controlling urban flooding through managed drainage, supplying recharge to production well fields through canal leakage, and managing seawater intrusion preventing saltwater contamination of freshwater aquifers.</p>

<p>Components of surface water management systems include canal networks (C-series and L-series canals), water control structures regulating water levels, stormwater best management practices (BMPs), retention and detention ponds, and integration with Miami-Dade County DERM canal systems <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/water/sewer/septic-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Miami-Dade County)</a>. Canal leakage from surface water management systems adjacent to well fields supplies 46-78 percent of total groundwater pumpage from production well fields, demonstrating critical interaction between surface water and groundwater systems essential for water supply <a href="https://www.epa.gov/septic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(EPA)</a>.</p>

<p>Surface water management systems needed for properties experiencing flooding issues, properties near major canals requiring integration with regional systems, properties in seawater intrusion zones needing freshwater management, and properties requiring stormwater compliance with Miami-Dade ordinances <a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/onsite-sewage/disposal-system-permits/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Florida DOH)</a>. Professional surface water management installation ensures proper integration with regional canal networks, compliance with Miami-Dade County stormwater ordinances and Environmental Resource Permit requirements, proper design accounting for canal-aquifer interaction, sea level rise considerations, and long-term system functionality.</p>
