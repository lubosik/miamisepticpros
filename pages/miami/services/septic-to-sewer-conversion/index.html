<h2 id="what-is">What is septic to sewer conversion?</h2>

<p>Septic to sewer conversion is process of transitioning property from independent septic tank system to centralized sanitary sewer system managed by Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (WASD). Conversion involves abandoning existing septic system and connecting property's plumbing to municipal sewer infrastructure typically located under or adjacent to street.</p>

<strong>Why conversion is required:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory requirement where sewer service available</li>
<li>Properties within WASD service areas must connect</li>
<li>Existing sewer laterals must be utilized</li>
<li>Eliminates reliance on individual septic systems</li>
<li>Access to centralized wastewater treatment</li>
<li>Required for environmental protection</li>
</ul>

<strong>When conversion is mandatory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Properties with existing sewer laterals on property</li>
<li>Properties within WASD service area</li>
<li>Municipal sewer infrastructure available</li>
<li>County regulations require connection</li>
<li>No longer optional where sewer accessible</li>
</ul>

<strong>Conversion benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eliminates septic system maintenance</li>
<li>No more septic pumping required</li>
<li>Access to professional wastewater treatment</li>
<li>Environmental protection</li>
<li>System reliability</li>
<li>Property development flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversion provides access to centralized wastewater infrastructure managed by Miami-Dade County. Where sewer service is available, connection is required rather than optional.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="process">Conversion process step-by-step</h2>

<p>Conversion process involves multiple coordinated steps across several government agencies:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Verify sewer lateral availability</strong>
<p>Verify existing sewer lateral located on property by submitting Utilities Information Request or checking As-built document to confirm sewer lateral availability. Lateral must exist before conversion can proceed. Verification confirms sewer access feasibility.</p>

<strong>Step 2: Obtain Sewer Capacity Certification</strong>
<p>Obtain Sewer Capacity Certification Letter from Miami-Dade County DRER Wastewater Section verifying sewer main has sufficient capacity for property's sewage flow demands. This is first required step and prerequisite for other permits. Certification confirms adequate sewer capacity.</p>

<strong>Step 3: Obtain WASD Allocation Letter</strong>
<p>Request allocation letter from DRER confirming property's sewage flow allocation based on usage and intended purpose. Allocation letter required for WASD connection approval. Letter determines property's flow allocation.</p>

<strong>Step 4: Obtain Plumbing Permit</strong>
<p>Obtain plumbing permit from either Miami-Dade County Building Department or applicable municipality depending on property location. Plumbing permit authorizes connection work and modifications. Permit ensures compliance with building codes.</p>

<strong>Step 5: Obtain Septic Abandonment Permit</strong>
<p>Obtain Pump-out and Abandon Permit from Florida Department of Health authorizing safe decommissioning and abandonment of existing septic system. Abandonment permit required before septic work begins. Permit ensures proper abandonment procedures.</p>

<strong>Step 6: WASD Approval and Connection Fees</strong>
<p>Present all certifications and permits to WASD New Business Office and pay calculated sewer connection fees. Connection fees calculated individually based on property usage. WASD approval required before connection work begins.</p>

<strong>Step 7: Septic Tank Abandonment</strong>
<p>Professional contractor pumps out septic tank, properly abandons system following Florida DOH procedures, and completes site restoration. Abandonment must prevent environmental contamination. Proper abandonment ensures system decommissioning.</p>

<strong>Step 8: Sewer Connection Installation</strong>
<p>Licensed contractor installs new sewer connection line from property to municipal sewer lateral, completes plumbing modifications, and ensures proper connections. Installation must meet plumbing code requirements. Connection enables sewer service.</p>

<strong>Step 9: Final Inspections</strong>
<p>Miami-Dade County Department of Health and local Building Department conduct final inspections verifying compliance with approved plans, checking proper installation, and approving system for use. System must pass inspections before activation.</p>

<strong>Step 10: Service Activation</strong>
<p>After successful inspection, WASD processes service connection. County allows 90 days after connection charges payment date before beginning process to start sewer billing, providing grace period for system verification and activation.</p>

<p>Following proper conversion process ensures compliance, proper abandonment, and successful sewer connection. Professional contractors manage entire process coordinating with all agencies.</p>
