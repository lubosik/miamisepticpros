<h1>Septic System Design and Permitting in Miami, FL</h1>

<p>Miami-Dade County Ordinance 22-83 effective January 1, 2023 prohibits conventional Type 1 septic systems for new installations, requiring Type 2 (secondary treatment), Type 3 (advanced secondary), or Type 4 (nutrient reduction) systems instead. Septic system design and permitting in Miami-Dade typically costs $1,500-$5,000 depending on system complexity, site conditions, engineering requirements, and DERM review timeline.</p>

<p>Design process includes site evaluation, soil testing, groundwater elevation assessment, system type selection, engineering design calculations, scaled site plan creation, and compliance verification with county and state regulations. All new or replacement systems require prior written approval from Miami-Dade DERM Director before construction, including site plan, soil evaluation data, system design specifications, and proof of property ownership.</p>

<p>New systems must maintain minimum 100 feet horizontal setback from surface water bodies, 50 feet from property lines, and drainfield bottom must be 36 inches above wet season high water table. DERM review and approval process typically takes 4-8 weeks after complete application submission, though timeline varies based on application completeness, site complexity, and DERM workload.</p>

</ul>

<p>System type selection depends on property use, sewage flow rate, proximity to surface water, and environmental sensitivity. Professional engineers determine appropriate system type based on site-specific conditions and regulations.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="design-process">Design process step-by-step</h2>

<p>Professional design process ensures proper system function and compliance:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Site evaluation and feasibility</strong>
<p>Comprehensive site evaluation assesses soil conditions, groundwater elevation, topography, proximity to water resources, and site suitability for onsite sewage treatment. Evaluation determines if site meets minimum requirements and identifies constraints affecting design.</p>

<strong>Step 2: Soil testing and characterization</strong>
<p>Detailed soil investigation includes soil permeability testing, soil boring data collection, seasonal high water table elevation determination, and soil suitability assessment. Soil data is essential for drainfield sizing and elevation requirements.</p>

<strong>Step 3: System type selection</strong>
<p>Based on evaluation results, engineer selects appropriate system type considering land use, projected sewage flow, proximity to surface water, and environmental sensitivity. System type affects treatment requirements and costs significantly.</p>

<strong>Step 4: Engineering design calculations</strong>
<p>Detailed calculations determine tank sizing, drainfield area requirements, treatment component specifications, and system capacity based on selected system type. Engineering ensures proper system sizing for expected usage.</p>

<strong>Step 5: Site plan creation</strong>
<p>Scaled site plan shows all structures, property lines, setback distances, system location relative to surface water, well locations if applicable, and all required measurements. Site plan demonstrates compliance with setback requirements.</p>

<strong>Step 6: Design specification development</strong>
<p>Complete design specifications include tank specifications, drainfield design details, treatment component requirements, installation specifications, and compliance with Chapter 62-6 requirements. Specifications guide installation and ensure compliance.</p>

<strong>Step 7: Compliance verification</strong>
<p>Final review verifies design meets all Miami-Dade County requirements including system type, setbacks, elevation, site conditions, and regulatory standards. Compliance verification ensures permit approval.</p>

<p>Following proper design process ensures system function, environmental protection, and regulatory compliance. Professional engineers manage entire design process meeting all requirements.</p>
