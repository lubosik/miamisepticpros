<h2 id="what-is">What is a holding tank?</h2>

<p>Holding tanks are watertight containers designed solely to store wastewater without processing or treating it. They collect all household wastewater including sewage, gray water, and other waste, and hold it until pumped out by professional service.</p>

<strong>How holding tanks work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All wastewater enters tank through inlet pipe</li>
<li>Wastewater stored in tank with no outlet</li>
<li>No treatment or processing occurs</li>
<li>Waste accumulates until pumped out</li>
<li>High-level alarm alerts when tank is full</li>
</ul>

<strong>When holding tanks are used:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Properties where septic systems cannot be installed due to soil conditions</li>
<li>High water table preventing drain field installation</li>
<li>Temporary housing or construction sites</li>
<li>Areas with restrictive building codes prohibiting septic systems</li>
<li>Properties waiting for sewer connection</li>
<li>Seasonal or vacation properties with low usage</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tank materials:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Polyethylene: Lightweight, durable, corrosion-resistant</li>
<li>Fiberglass: Strong, long-lasting, resistant to chemicals</li>
