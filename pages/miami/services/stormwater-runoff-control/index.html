<h1>Stormwater Runoff Control in Miami, FL</h1>

<p>Stormwater runoff control in Miami typically costs $3,000-$20,000 for property-level systems depending on size, BMP types, pollution control devices, and compliance requirements, with basic systems costing $3,000-$8,000 and comprehensive systems costing $15,000-$30,000. Stormwater runoff is rain and tidal water flowing over driveways, lawns, sidewalks, and streets collecting debris, chemicals, fertilizers, auto fluids, and other pollutants before entering stormwater systems, making stormwater runoff a major source of pollution in waterways.</p>

<p>The first one inch of runoff generally carries 90% of the pollution from a storm, making treatment of the first flush critical to proper stormwater management and requiring minimum treatment of the first one inch of runoff from new development. Stormwater runoff control serves three primary objectives: draining stormwater quickly from impervious surfaces preventing flooding and protecting public safety, cleaning contaminants before discharge into receiving waters, and managing stormwater to recharge groundwater supplies for drinking water availability.</p>

<p>Best management practices for stormwater runoff include pollution reduction through public education and good housekeeping practices, surface drainage and flood protection, erosion and sedimentation control, enhanced aesthetics and recreational opportunities, and reuse of stormwater as valuable water resource. Professional stormwater runoff control installation ensures proper BMP selection for property needs, compliance with NPDES permit requirements and Miami-Dade County ordinances, treatment of first flush runoff, integration with municipal stormwater systems, pollution control device installation, and long-term system effectiveness protecting Biscayne Bay water quality.</p>
