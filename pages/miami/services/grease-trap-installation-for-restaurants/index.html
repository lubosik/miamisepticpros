<h1>Grease Trap Installation for Restaurants in Miami, FL</h1>

<p>Grease traps intercept fats, oils, greases (FOG), and solid food waste before entering municipal wastewater system, functioning as containment boxes separating materials by density to prevent pipe blockages. Grease trap installation for restaurants in Miami-Dade typically costs $2,000-$15,000 depending on trap size, material type, installation location, site conditions, and complexity.</p>

<p>Restaurants produce substantially more FOG than residential kitchens due to continuous food preparation requiring proper grease interception to prevent sewer backups and environmental pollution. Most local governments including Miami-Dade legally require restaurants to maintain grease traps to protect municipal sewer systems, with health department inspections verifying proper installation and function.</p>

<p>Regular cleaning schedules are essential to prevent grease buildup, clogs, overflows, and system failures, with proper maintenance protecting communities from health hazards and helping restaurants avoid fines. Professional installation ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County regulations, proper trap sizing based on kitchen flow rates, correct positioning, environmental protection, and long-term reliability.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is a grease trap?</h2>

<p>Grease traps (also called grease interceptors) are plumbing devices that intercept fats, oils, greases (FOG), and solid food waste before they enter the municipal wastewater system. They function as containment boxes that wastewater flows through before entering the drainage system.</p>

<strong>How grease traps work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wastewater from sinks, dishwashers, and floor drains flows into trap</li>
<li>System separates materials by density</li>
<li>Solids settle to bottom of container</li>
<li>Greases and oils float to surface</li>
<li>Cleaner water passes through to sewer system</li>
</ul>

<strong>Why restaurants need grease traps:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants produce substantially more FOG than residential kitchens</li>
<li>Continuous food preparation creates large volumes of greasy wastewater</li>
<li>Grease solidifies when cooled and can block drain pipes</li>
<li>Prevents sewer backups and environmental pollution</li>
<li>Legal requirement in most jurisdictions including Miami-Dade</li>
<li>Required for business license and health department approval</li>
</ul>

<strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prevents pipe blockages and sewer backups</li>
<li>Protects municipal sewer systems</li>
<li>Environmental protection</li>
<li>Compliance with legal requirements</li>
<li>Prevents fines and penalties</li>
<li>Maintains restaurant operations</li>
</ul>

<p>Grease traps are essential for restaurants to protect plumbing systems and comply with Miami-Dade County requirements. Proper installation and maintenance ensure effective operation.</p>

<hr />
