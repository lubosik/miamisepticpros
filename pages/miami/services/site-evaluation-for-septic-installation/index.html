<h1>Site Evaluation for Septic Installation in Miami, FL</h1>

<p>Site evaluations must be performed by licensed engineer or other qualified professional as mandated by Florida regulations, ensuring standardized professional assessment before any septic system can be permitted. Site evaluations fundamentally involve soil percolation testing to measure how quickly water flows through native soil, which directly determines absorption capacity and required absorption field size for system design.</p>

<p>Evaluations include comprehensive property assessment for nearby boundaries, water wells, topography, surface waters, and environmental factors between natural groundwater and wastewater contamination concerns. Site evaluations are formally documented using DH4015 form which becomes part of official permit application, documenting all findings including soil characteristics, property features, and environmental conditions.</p>

<p>Effective January 1, 2023, Miami-Dade County prohibits conventional Type 1 septic systems for new installations, requiring site evaluations to support design of Type 2, 3, or 4 systems based on environmental sensitivity. Professional site evaluation ensures compliance with Miami-Dade County regulations, proper system design, environmental protection, groundwater quality protection, and long-term system reliability.</p>

<h2 id="what-is">What is a septic site evaluation?</h2>

<p>Septic site evaluation is critical preliminary assessment conducted to determine whether property is suitable for installation of onsite sewage treatment and disposal system (OSTDS). Evaluation involves comprehensive examination of soil characteristics, environmental conditions, and property features to ensure septic system can function safely and effectively while protecting groundwater and surface waters from contamination.</p>

<strong>Purpose of site evaluation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Determine site suitability for septic system</li>
<li>Assess soil characteristics and percolation rate</li>
<li>Evaluate environmental conditions and constraints</li>
<li>Identify property features affecting system design</li>
<li>Determine appropriate system type and size</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements</li>
</ul>

<strong>Why evaluation is required:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory before septic system can be permitted</li>
<li>Florida regulations require professional evaluation</li>
<li>Ensures proper system design and placement</li>
<li>Protects groundwater and environmental resources</li>
<li>Required for permit application</li>
<li>Foundation for system design decisions</li>
</ul>

<strong>Who performs evaluation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Licensed engineer</li>
<li>Qualified professional</li>
<li>Must meet state licensing requirements</li>
<li>Professional credentials verified</li>
<li>Experience in septic system evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Site evaluation provides foundation for septic system design and installation. Professional evaluation ensures accurate assessment and proper documentation for permit application.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="process">Evaluation process step-by-step</h2>

<p>Site evaluation follows structured process ensuring comprehensive assessment:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Initial property inspection</strong>
<p>Qualified professional conducts on-site inspection examining property layout, identifying structures and features, assessing topography and slope, locating water features, and gathering preliminary information. Inspection provides initial assessment of property conditions.</p>

<strong>Step 2: Property feature identification</strong>
<p>Identify and document property boundaries, nearby property lines, existing structures and buildings, water wells on or near property, surface water bodies, wetlands, and environmental features. Feature identification determines constraints affecting system placement.</p>

<strong>Step 3: Soil percolation testing</strong>
<p>Conduct soil percolation testing at representative locations where absorption field will be installed. Testing measures how quickly water flows through native soil. Percolation rate directly determines required absorption field size. Multiple test locations may be needed.</p>

<strong>Step 4: Soil analysis</strong>
<p>Analyze soil composition and type including soil texture, structure, and characteristics. Different soil types have different percolation rates. Clay soils percolate slowly requiring larger fields. Sandy soils percolate quickly but may not provide adequate treatment. Soil analysis determines percolation capacity.</p>

<strong>Step 5: Groundwater depth assessment</strong>
<p>Determine depth to groundwater at site. Shallow groundwater requires enhanced treatment and different system configurations. Deep groundwater may allow conventional designs but requires verification of adequate separation distances. Groundwater depth affects system type selection.</p>

<strong>Step 6: Setback distance verification</strong>
<p>Verify required setback distances from property lines, water wells, surface water bodies, structures, and other features. Setback requirements must be met for system placement. Verification ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>

<strong>Step 7: Environmental factor assessment</strong>
<p>Assess environmental factors including proximity to surface waters, environmental sensitivity, groundwater protection needs, and potential contamination risks. Environmental assessment determines system type requirements and treatment specifications.</p>

<strong>Step 8: Documentation and reporting</strong>
<p>Complete DH4015 form documenting all findings including soil characteristics, property features, environmental conditions, percolation test results, and evaluation conclusions. Documentation becomes part of official permit application. Report provides basis for system design.</p>

<p>Following proper evaluation process ensures comprehensive assessment and proper documentation. Professional evaluation provides foundation for septic system design and installation.</p>
