</div>

<p>New septic system installation costs vary significantly based on system type, size, site conditions, and installation complexity. Most Miami-Dade homeowners spend $8,000-$25,000 for professional installation including permits, site evaluation, and system components.</p>

<strong>Factors affecting costs:</strong>

<p><strong>System type:</strong> Type 2 systems cost $8,000-$15,000 for residential installations. Type 3 systems cost $12,000-$20,000 with advanced treatment. Type 4 systems cost $15,000-$30,000 with nutrient reduction. More advanced systems cost more but provide better environmental protection.</p>

<p><strong>System size:</strong> Small residential systems (1,000-1,500 gallons) cost $8,000-$15,000. Standard systems (1,500-2,000 gallons) cost $12,000-$20,000. Large systems (2,000+ gallons) cost $18,000-$30,000. Commercial systems cost $20,000-$50,000 or more depending on size.</p>

<p><strong>Site conditions:</strong> Easy sites with good soil and drainage cost standard rates. Difficult sites requiring special design cost $2,000-$5,000 more. High water table sites require elevated drainfields adding $3,000-$8,000. Rocky or difficult excavation adds $2,000-$6,000.</p>

<p><strong>Permits and approvals:</strong> Site evaluation and soil testing cost $500-$1,500. Permit fees cost $500-$2,000 depending on system type. Engineering design costs $1,000-$3,000 for complex sites. Professional permits and approvals are essential and included in installation costs.</p>

<p><strong>Installation complexity:</strong> Standard installation costs base rates. Complex installations with multiple tanks or advanced treatment cost $3,000-$10,000 more. Pump systems for elevation differences add $2,000-$5,000. Specialized equipment or techniques add to costs.</p>

<strong>What's typically included:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Site evaluation and soil testing</li>
<li>System design and engineering</li>
<li>Permit applications and approvals</li>
<li>Tank and system components</li>
<li>Professional excavation and installation</li>

</ul>

<p>Installation costs are significant investments, but proper installation ensures system function, environmental protection, and compliance with Miami-Dade County requirements. Professional contractors provide comprehensive installation services.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="process">Installation process step-by-step</h2>

<p>New septic system installation follows structured process ensuring compliance and proper function:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Site evaluation and soil testing</strong>
<p>Licensed professional conducts comprehensive site evaluation including soil percolation testing to measure how quickly water flows through native soil, soil composition analysis to identify soil type and properties, property boundary assessment to verify setback compliance, water well identification to ensure minimum separation distances, surface water mapping to identify proximity to water bodies, topographic analysis to evaluate elevation and drainage, and environmental sensitivity evaluation. Site evaluation determines appropriate system type and design.</p>

<strong>Step 2: System design and planning</strong>
<p>Based on site evaluation results, professional engineer or qualified designer creates system design meeting Miami-Dade County requirements. Design includes tank size and type selection, drainfield sizing and layout, treatment system specifications, elevation and setback compliance, and construction specifications. Design must meet Type 2, Type 3, or Type 4 requirements depending on site conditions.</p>

<strong>Step 3: Permit application</strong>
<p>Submit required documentation to Miami-Dade DERM including site plan showing property boundaries and system location, building plan showing proposed construction, site evaluation results including soil testing data, system design specifications, and permit application forms. Prior written approval from DERM Director is required before installation can begin.</p>

<strong>Step 4: Permit approval</strong>
<p>DERM reviews application for compliance with regulations, verifies setback requirements, evaluates system design appropriateness, and issues approval or requests modifications. Review process typically takes several weeks to months depending on application completeness and complexity.</p>

<strong>Step 5: Professional installation</strong>
<p>Licensed contractor performs installation including excavation for tank and drainfield, tank placement and leveling, drainfield construction and pipe installation, backfilling and soil compaction, and connection to building plumbing. Installation must follow approved design specifications exactly.</p>

<strong>Step 6: Inspection and approval</strong>
<p>After installation completion, state inspector conducts final inspection to verify compliance with approved design, check proper installation practices, ensure setback requirements are met, and approve system for use. System must pass inspection before use.</p>

<strong>Step 7: System registration</strong>
<p>Register completed system with DERM as required by county ordinance. Registration provides system documentation for future reference and compliance tracking.</p>

<p>Following proper installation process ensures system function, environmental protection, and regulatory compliance. Professional contractors manage entire process efficiently.</p>
