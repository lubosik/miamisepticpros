<h1>Septic Permit Application and Approvals in Miami, FL</h1>

<p>All new or replacement septic systems require mandatory prior written approval from Miami-Dade DERM Director before construction begins, making permit approval essential first step in installation process. Septic permit application in Miami-Dade typically costs $500-$2,000 in permit fees depending on system type, property use, and application complexity, with additional costs for site evaluation, design, and engineering services.</p>

<p>Permit application requires scaled site plan showing structures, property lines, setbacks, system location, soil evaluation report, OSTDS design specifications conforming to Chapter 62-6, and professional engineer credentials. DERM review and approval process typically takes 4-8 weeks after complete application submission, though timeline varies based on application completeness, site complexity, and DERM workload.</p>

<p>Required documentation includes DEP4015 application forms, sewer capacity certification from DRER, site plan with property boundaries and setbacks, system design plans, proof of property ownership, and contractor licensing information. After permit approval, contractors must schedule and pass inspections by Miami-Dade County Department of Health and building department before backfill and site restoration, with system becoming operational only after final inspection approval.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="process">Application process step-by-step</h2>

<p>Permit application follows structured sequence ensuring proper approval:</p>

<strong>Step 1: Site evaluation and design</strong>
<p>Complete site evaluation and system design including soil testing, system type selection, engineering design, and preparation of design specifications. Site evaluation and design must be completed before permit application. Design provides foundation for permit approval.</p>

<strong>Step 2: Compile required documentation</strong>
<p>Gather all required documentation including DEP4015 application forms, site plan with property boundaries and setbacks, soil evaluation report, system design specifications, proof of property ownership, contractor licensing information, and professional engineer credentials. Documentation completeness essential for approval.</p>

<strong>Step 3: Submit DERM application</strong>
<p>Submit complete application package to Miami-Dade DERM including all required documentation, permit application forms, design plans, and supporting materials. Application submission initiates review process. Complete applications process faster than incomplete submissions.</p>

<strong>Step 4: DERM review process</strong>
<p>DERM reviews application for compliance with Ordinance 22-83, verifies system design meets requirements, checks documentation completeness, evaluates site conditions and constraints, and determines approval or denial. Review process typically takes 4-8 weeks.</p>

<strong>Step 5: Address any deficiencies</strong>
<p>If DERM requests additional information or revisions, respond promptly with required materials, revise designs if needed, provide clarification on any issues, and resubmit revised application. Addressing deficiencies promptly prevents delays.</p>

<strong>Step 6: Receive DERM approval</strong>
<p>DERM issues approval letter authorizing construction to begin. Approval includes conditions and requirements that must be met. Approval letter required before installation can start.</p>

<strong>Step 7: Obtain additional permits</strong>
<p>After DERM approval, obtain building department permit, health department approval if required, and any additional local permits needed. Multiple agency permits may be required depending on location.</p>

<strong>Step 8: Begin installation</strong>
<p>After all permits obtained, licensed contractor can begin installation following approved plans and specifications. Installation must comply with permit conditions.</p>

<p>Following proper application process ensures timely approval and compliance. Professional contractors manage entire process coordinating with all agencies.</p>
