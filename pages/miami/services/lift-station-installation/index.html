<h2 id="what-is">What is a lift station?</h2>

<p>Lift stations (also called pump stations) are critical components of wastewater infrastructure that pump sewage from lower elevations to higher elevations or to treatment facilities when gravity flow is not feasible. They become necessary when topography, geological conditions, or location of service areas make gravity-fed sewer systems impractical.</p>

<strong>How lift stations work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wastewater flows into wet well (sump area)</li>
<li>Pumps activate when wastewater reaches certain level</li>
<li>Pumps push wastewater through force main pipe</li>
<li>Wastewater discharged to higher elevation or treatment facility</li>
<li>Control systems monitor pump operation and levels</li>
</ul>

<strong>When lift stations are needed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Flat topography preventing gravity flow</li>
<li>Low elevation areas requiring elevation lift</li>
<li>Long distances requiring pressure assistance</li>
<li>Properties below sewer main elevation</li>
<li>Multiple properties requiring centralized pumping</li>
<li>Areas where gravity sewer not economically feasible</li>
</ul>

<strong>Components:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wet well: Sump area collecting incoming wastewater</li>
<li>Pumps: Submersible or dry well pumps moving wastewater</li>
<li>Control systems: Monitoring and automatic pump operation</li>
<li>Force main: Pipe carrying pumped wastewater</li>
<li>Electrical systems: Power supply and control panels</li>
<li>Ventilation: Safety systems for confined spaces</li>
</ul>

<p>Lift stations enable wastewater collection and transmission in areas where gravity systems cannot function. In Miami-Dade's flat topography, lift stations are essential for wastewater infrastructure.</p>

<hr />
