Grease interceptors are specialized plumbing devices designed to capture and reduce amount of fats, oils, and grease (FOG) in wastewater from commercial food operations, functioning as containment boxes separating waste materials by density with lighter grease floating to top while water and heavier food particles sink to bottom, trapping waste from plate rinsing sinks, dishwashers, and food disposal systems.</p>

<p>Grease interceptor cleaning important because accumulated fats, oils, and grease can cause blockages in plumbing systems and municipal sewer lines, with regular cleaning maintaining system functionality, preventing costly repairs, protecting environment by properly managing wastewater, ensuring compliance with health department requirements, and helping businesses avoid penalties and closure. Grease interceptors need cleaning at least annually recommended by professionals, though more frequent cleaning every three months or even monthly may be necessary depending on system size, volume of grease-producing activities, local regulations, and compliance requirements specific to Miami-Dade County area.</p>

<p>Professional grease interceptor cleaning involves thorough emptying and cleaning of entire interceptor system using state-of-the-art line-jetting technology and hydro-jetting systems using high-pressure water to blast away stubborn grease buildup, inspection and assessment to identify damage or structural issues, repairs addressing broken components, proper documentation and compliance records, and resealing and deodorizing service area. Professional grease interceptor cleaning benefits include prevention of blockages maintaining system efficiency, compliance with Miami-Dade health regulations preventing violations and fines, protection of municipal sewer systems preventing environmental contamination, prevention of costly repairs and operational disruptions, proper documentation ensuring regulatory compliance, and same-day emergency service availability for urgent situations.</p>
