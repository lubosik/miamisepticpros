## Why Your Sinks Drain Slowly

Slow-draining sinks are often an early warning sign of septic system problems, especially when multiple fixtures are affected.

## Common Causes

- Full septic tank restricting flow
- Blocked drain lines or vents
- Failing drainfield causing backups

## Solutions

Schedule a septic inspection to identify the root cause and determine the best course of action.
