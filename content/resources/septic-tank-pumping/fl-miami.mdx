## What Is Septic Tank Pumping?

Septic tank pumping removes accumulated solids from your tank using a vacuum truck. Over time, sludge and scum reduce capacity and can overflow into the drainfield, leading to expensive failures.

## Why You Need Pumping in Miami

- High water table and porous limestone soils increase the risk of drainfield stress.
- Regular maintenance prevents backups and odors, especially during rainy season.
- Documented service helps with real estate transactions and insurance.

## How Septic Pumping Works

1. Locate the access riser or tank lid
2. Vacuum pump removes liquids and solids
3. Technician inspects baffles and structural condition
4. Rinse and backflush as needed
5. Provide service report and maintenance interval
