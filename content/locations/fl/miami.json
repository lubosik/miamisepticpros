  "localInsights": "## Septic Systems in Miami\n\nMiami's high water table and porous limestone soil present unique challenges for septic systems. Most systems in Miami-Dade County require elevated drainfields or aerobic treatment units to meet Florida Department of Health regulations.\n\n### Local Regulations\n\nMiami-Dade County enforces strict septic system regulations. All installations, repairs, and replacements require permits from the Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County. Tanks must be inspected during real estate transactions, and pumping records should be maintained.\n\n### Climate Considerations\n\nSouth Florida's heavy rainfall (60+ inches annually) and hurricane season can stress septic systems. Flooding can damage drainfields and contaminate tanks. After major storms, have your system inspected by a licensed contractor to ensure proper operation.\n\n### Common Issues\n\n- **High water table:** Can cause drainfields to fail or become saturated\n- **Saltwater intrusion:** Coastal areas may experience saltwater damage to concrete tanks\n- **Tree roots:** Mature tropical trees can infiltrate tanks and drainfields\n- **Heavy usage:** Year-round warm weather increases water usage and system load",
