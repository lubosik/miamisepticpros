  "fullDescription": "## What Is Septic Tank Pumping?\n\nSeptic tank pumping is the process of removing accumulated solids (sludge and scum) from your septic tank using a vacuum truck. Over time, these solids build up and reduce the tank's effective capacity. If not pumped regularly, solids can overflow into the drainfield, causing system failure and costly repairs.\n\n## Why You Need Regular Pumping\n\n- **Prevent backups:** Full tanks can cause sewage backups into your home\n- **Extend system life:** Regular pumping can add 10-20 years to your system\n- **Avoid drainfield damage:** Solids in the drainfield are expensive to fix\n- **Maintain health standards:** Proper maintenance prevents groundwater contamination\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Locate the tank access port (we can help if you don't know where it is)\n2. Pump out all liquids and solids using a vacuum truck\n3. Inspect tank condition and baffles\n4. Rinse and backflush if needed\n5. Document service for your records",
