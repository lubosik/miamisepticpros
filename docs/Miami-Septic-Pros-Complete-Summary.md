## Current Site Structure

### File Locations

#### Articles
- **Path:** `/pages/miami/services/[slug]/index.html`
- **Format:** HTML with front matter (YAML)
- **Example:** `/pages/miami/services/septic-tank-pumping/index.html`

#### Category Hub Pages

- `/pages/miami/services/septic-system-contractor/index.mdx`
- `/pages/miami/services/drainage-contractor/index.mdx`
- `/pages/miami/services/sewage-treatment-service/index.mdx`

### Current Routing

#### Next.js App Router (Active)
- **Homepage:** `/app/(site)/page.tsx` - Shows hardcoded list of 16 services
- **Services Page:** `/app/(site)/services/page.tsx` - Loads from `getAllServices()`
- **Service Detail Pages:** `/app/(site)/services/[slug]/page.tsx` - Not yet configured for Miami articles
- **Locations:** `/app/(site)/locations/[state]/[city]/page.tsx`

#### Pages Router (Legacy - Contains Articles)
- **Articles:** `/pages/miami/services/[slug]/index.html` - All 54 articles live here
- **Category Hubs:** `/pages/miami/services/[category-slug]/index.mdx`

### Service Data Sources

#### Current Service Definitions

## Gaps & Synchronization Needs

### Critical Issues to Address

#### 1. **Service Data Mismatch**
- ❌ `/data/services.json` has 39 services with old categories
- ✅ `/msp/queue/categories.json` has correct 54 services with new categories
- **Action Needed:** Update `/data/services.json` to match category structure

#### 2. **Homepage Service List**
- ❌ Homepage (`/app/(site)/page.tsx`) shows hardcoded list of 16 services
- ✅ Should show all 54 services organized by category
- **Action Needed:** Update homepage to load from categories.json and display by category

#### 3. **Services Page Integration**
- ⚠️ Services page loads from `getAllServices()` which reads from `/content/services/*.json`
- ❌ No JSON files exist for the 54 Miami articles
- **Action Needed:** Either:
  - Create JSON files in `/content/services/` for each service, OR
  - Update service loader to read from `/pages/miami/services/` directory

#### 4. **Service Detail Page Routing**
- ❌ `/app/(site)/services/[slug]/page.tsx` doesn't route to Miami articles
- ✅ Articles exist at `/pages/miami/services/[slug]/index.html`
- **Action Needed:** Configure Next.js to serve Miami articles at `/services/[slug]` or create redirects

#### 5. **Category Hub Pages**
- ✅ Category hub pages exist at `/pages/miami/services/[category-slug]/index.mdx`
- ❌ Not linked from main navigation or homepage
- **Action Needed:** Add category navigation to homepage and services page

#### 6. **Missing Service Mappings**
Check if these services from old data need articles:
- `routine-septic-maintenance` (different from `routine-septic-service-contracts`?)
- `septic-system-cleaning` (different from `septic-tank-cleaning`?)
- `effluent-filter-cleaning` (different from `septic-filter-cleaning-replacement`?)
- `risers-installation` (different from `septic-tank-riser-installation`?)
- `pre-purchase-septic-inspection` (different from `real-estate-septic-inspections`?)

### Phase 2: Update Homepage

1. **Add Category Sections**
   - Display services grouped by category
   - Show category name, description, and service count
   - Link to category hub pages

## Next Steps for AI Assistant

### Prompt Suggestions

When creating prompts for synchronization, include:

1. **Context:** "The Miami Septic Pros site has 54 service articles organized into 4 categories. Each service needs to be synchronized across homepage, services page, category pages, and resource pages."

2. **Requirements:**
   - Every service must have a corresponding article
   - Services must be grouped by category
   - Category pages must link to all services in that category
   - Homepage should display categories prominently
   - Services page should show all 54 services with filtering

3. **Data Sources:**
   - Category definitions: `/msp/queue/categories.json`
   - Articles: `/pages/miami/services/[slug]/index.html`
   - Service data: `/data/services.json` (needs update)
   - Service loader: `/lib/content/services.ts`

4. **Key Constraints:**
   - All 54 articles exist and are complete
   - Articles use HTML format with YAML front matter
   - Next.js App Router handles routing
   - Need to bridge legacy `/pages/` structure with App Router

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Articles:** 54 ✅
- **Total Categories:** 4
- **Articles Completed:** 54/54 (100%)
- **Migration Status:** Complete
